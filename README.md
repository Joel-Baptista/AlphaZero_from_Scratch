# AlphaZero_from_Scratch
Understanding the AlphaZero algorithm by coding it, following the tutorial in: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuSQpLinRB4&amp;list=WL&amp;index=8&amp;ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org 


This project started as a simple exploration of the AlphaZero tutorial, but has since evolved with a focus on developing a Chess AI. We've determined that Python may not be the best fit for achieving our performance goals, so we're transitioning the project to a new repository using C++ (https://github.com/Joel-Baptista/YACE). Our next steps will involve building the chess engine from the ground up.
